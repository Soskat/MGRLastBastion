Dear friend,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I know you're not one for pleasantries, so let me cut straight to the chase.

During my last investigation I had to look into one of the many cults of Boston's underbelly. We were chasing a murderer that left his victims with eyes burnt out, their hands tied as if a mockery of praying.

The book you will find in the package was found in his base of operations. I glanced into it briefly. Judging by the sketches, it might be his Codex or some way of planning his murders. I tried googling the script used in the book and concluded it's written entirely in ancient Sumerian. 

Since you are the only person that I know of that could try and decipher this tome, I turn to you. If you find any information that can help us apprehend the killer, please contact me immediately.

I will owe you yet another favor and the city of Boston - eternal grattitude.

Best regards,
John Murphy

PS As an incentive I'm sending you a bottle of your favorite vintage. If anyone asks - you didn't get it from me
